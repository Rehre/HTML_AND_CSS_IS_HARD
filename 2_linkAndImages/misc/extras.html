    <h2>Character Encoding</h2>
    <p>You can use UTF-8 to count in Turkish:</p>
    <p>
      Try removing the &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"/&gt; in this file to see the
      difference
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>bir</li>
      <li>iki</li>
      <li>üç</li>
      <li>dört</li>
      <li>beş</li>
    </ol>

      If you&rsquo;re into &ldquo;web typography,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll also find
      yourself using curly quotes quite a bit using HTML Entities
